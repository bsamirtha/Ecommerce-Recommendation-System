# Ecommerce-Recommendation-System

# Context 

In today's digital age, e-commerce platforms thrive on delivering personalized experiences to attract and retain customers.The e-commerce recommendation system is designed to transform how users interact with online shopping by providing tailored product suggestions based on individual preferences and behaviors.By leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms and customer data, the system analyzes past interactions to predict and recommend products that users are most likely to enjoy.Through the integration of collaborative filtering and content-based methods, the recommendation engine addresses common challenges and ensures relevant, engaging product recommendations for every user.

# Dataset
I used the Amazon Electronics Rating Dataset from Kaggle, which provides user ratings for electronic products. You can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vibivij/amazon-electronics-rating-datasetrecommendation/download?datasetVersionNumber=1).

# Flow 

- **Importing Libraries**: Load essential libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Loading Dataset**: Import the Amazon Electronics Rating Dataset.
- **Missing Value Analysis**: Assess and handle missing values in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform initial data exploration to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns.
- **Density of the Rating Matrix**: Analyze the sparsity of the user-item rating matrix.
- **Rank-Based Recommendation System**: Implement a recommendation system based on item ranking.
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Develop a user-based collaborative filtering model to recommend items based on similar users.
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Apply SVD to decompose the rating matrix and improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Evaluating the Model**: Assess the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like RMSE.

- Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise version of the key learnings for GitHub:

## Key Learnings

### Skewness in Ratings Distribution
- **Insight:** The mean (4.01) is below the median (5.00), indicating a negative skew with most ratings clustered at the higher end (5.00).
- **Impact:** This skew may influence recommendation model performance, reflecting a tendency towards high ratings with occasional lower ratings.

### Density of Rating Matrix
- **Higher Density:** Indicates rich data, enhancing recommendation accuracy.
  - **Actions:** Utilize this data for advanced collaborative filtering, explore hybrid methods, and validate across diverse segments.
- **Lower Density:** Reflects sparse interactions, challenging model accuracy.
  - **Actions:** Apply SVD for dimensionality reduction, use hybrid approaches, impute missing values, boost user engagement, and integrate external data.

### Sparse vs. Dense Matrix
- **Sparse Matrix:** Many missing entries, common in large datasets with extensive unobserved interactions.
- **Dense Matrix:** Fewer missing entries, typical in smaller datasets with more complete data.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Application:** Handles sparse matrices by decomposing and reconstructing data to predict missing entries.
  - **Process:** Normalize ratings, apply SVD to decompose, reconstruct the matrix, and generate recommendations.
  - **Benefits:** Efficient for large datasets and improves recommendation accuracy by uncovering latent patterns.
